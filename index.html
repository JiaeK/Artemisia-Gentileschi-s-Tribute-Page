      <h3>Who Was Artemisia Gentileschi?</h3>
      <p>Artemisia Gentileschi was an Italian Baroque painter. She painted her earliest signed and dated work, "Susanna and the Elders," around 1610, and later created such works as "Madonna and Child, "Judith Slaying Holofernes" and "Cleopatra." Gentileschi lived in Florence for several years and later spent time in Genoa and Venice. In 1630, she moved to Naples. Around 1638, she and her father, Orazio Gentileschi, worked together on a series for Queen Henrietta Maria.

      <h3>Her Life and Art</h3>
      <p>Her mother died in childbirth when her only daughter was just 12. Her father, a successful artist and a friend of Caravaggio, was perhaps surprised when he realised that his talents had passed not to his three sons but to his daughter. At the time, women were not allowed to become members of the all-important artistic guilds or the academies, but Artemisia would go on to become the first female member of the Accademia in Florence in 1616.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Orazio encouraged Artemisia, and being the daughter of an artist meant she could access what most young women could never hope for – training. It meant, too, that she got to know Caravaggio’s work, which would prove pivotal to her output.</p>
      <p>But she also met an artist called Agostino Tassi, who worked alongside her father and, when she was 17, raped her. When Tassi refused to marry her, Orazio took him to court.</p>
      <p>In the trial that followed, Artemisia, the victim – rather than Tassi, the perpetrator – was tortured to ascertain if she was telling the truth. “It is true. It is true. It is true. It is true,” she cried as they crushed the fingers she needed to continue to wield a paintbrush.</p>
      <p>Tassi was found guilty, though not forced to serve his sentence. As the National Gallery’s show will reveal, Gentileschi never forgot the injustice done to her, and to so many women.</p>
      <p>Her major art piece, Judith Beheading Holofernes (c1612-1613), the work the crowds were so eager to see in Florence. It is based on a biblical story – of a woman who takes revenge on a soldier who had tried to wrong her – that inspired many artists, including Caravaggio. Gentileschi gives it her own interpretation. “She’s imagining, as a woman, what it would take to decapitate a muscular man,” said Treves. “You see the determination and resolve in her face.”</p>
      <p>Other painting of Judith and her maidservant a few minutes after they’ve beheaded Holofernes, which shows “a spirit of sisterhood, of women in it together”, and a portrait of Mary Magdalene in which her usual penitence is replaced with a look of passionate eroticism.</p>
      <p>She is “Caravaggio’s boldest and most-inspired follower – his artistic heir”. She juggled being a wife, mother and lover with adventurous travels, money troubles and the deaths of most of her children.</p>
